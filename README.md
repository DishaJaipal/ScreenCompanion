# 🚀 ScreenCompanion

> Boosting productivity with real-time, context-aware suggestions to keep you focused and efficient.

## 📌 Problem Statement
 
****
In today’s world, staying productive is harder than ever with constant distractions, multitasking, and mental fatigue. Traditional tools don't offer the personalized, real-time help people need to stay focused.

We’re building a smart screen productivity assistant that uses OCR to understand what the user is doing and provides real-time suggestions to stay focused. These could include things like music recommendations, focus mode activation, or help with writing emails. The app runs locally, is lightweight, and works silently in the background as a desktop tray app, making it easy to stay on track without distractions.

## 🎯 Objective

Our project captures screen content in real-time, extracts meaningful text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and streams the data using Fluvio for downstream processing.
It serves teams or individuals who need live screen monitoring, text extraction, or real-time analytics from screen activities — helpful for accessibility, productivity tools, or automating workflows.

We enhance the extracted text using Groq's ultra-fast LLM inference for real-time insights and pattern detection, enabling instant feedback or action suggestions based on screen activity.

### Our Approach:  
- Why we chose this problem :
  We wanted to build something that actually makes our daily lives better—especially with how easy it is to get distracted or overwhelmed when you're working on a laptop all day. So, we came up with this idea   
 of a smart screen productivity assistant that can understand what the user is doing and give helpful, real-time suggestions to stay on track. We wanted it to feel lightweight, run locally, and still be smart— 
 so no bloated apps. Optional cloud features were a bonus for personalization later.
  
- Key challenges we addressed :
  Screen Understanding Without SDK Access: Since the ScreenPipe SDK wasn’t publicly available, we creatively used Terminator (UI automation) and OCR tools to simulate contextual screen awareness.
  AI Suggestions: We integrated the Groq API to generate accurate, relevant suggestions (like recommending music, activating focus mode, or drafting emails).
  Desktop-Friendly UX: We ensured the assistant works as a tray app, is lightweight, and doesn’t interrupt the user.
  Collaborative Development: We balanced 4 contributors working on different but interconnected parts.

- Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking  :
  🧠 Initially, we planned on screen recording + content classification, but pivoted to UI automation + OCR due to SDK access limits.
  🔁 We creatively reused Fluvio for non-standard use cases, like streaming OCR data in real-time.
  🧩 We brainstormed how to structure recommendations using Groq and simple logic from OCR context.
  🎯 Combining screen structure via Terminator + text context via OCR gave us a powerful foundation for screen awareness.
  🛠️ We integrated components like Groq, OCR, and the GUI into a modular system that can be improved later with the actual ScreenPipe SDK or ML models.
